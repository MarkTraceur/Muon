Muon
====

This is a command line pump.io client using urwid, a curses library. This is
still in alpha and I only work on it during my free time, because of that it
is likely going to be a while before It's usable for the general public.

If you do wish to try it, awesome! Do remember things won't work, it won't be
feature complete and it is likely to be increadably buggy.

Installation
============

Installing this is currently going to mean basic use of git, which means you need
to install git. Once you've got git do:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/xray7224/Muon.git
    $ virtualenv . && pip install pypump urwid
```

To update you can then just do:

```
    $ git pull
```

Continue to check here as I could add more dependences or instructions.

Bugs || Feature requests
========================

So, any new bugs, feel free to report using GitHubs issue tracker.
I don't want any feature requests yet, I will in time but not this
early on in the development.
